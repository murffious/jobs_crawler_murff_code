& many many more

problem: So many job sites just link you to the actual careers page of a particular chosen site and tons and tons of jobs are actually not psoted on indeed, glassdoor, dice etc. Goal:find all jobs posted on all company's careers pages in a given area , or distance range. like a 30 minute commute or thereabouts. Then be able to quick apply to those jobs like with google auto fill and ezpply extension chrome type of stuff - also being able to weed out for experience level and language or skills - probably a great activity to learn machine learning 

Might need to find a list all all companies in the zipcode somehow. City data gov't sites may help heopfully for free

Open source project hoping to provide a similar service as jobpikr but for free and for job searchers fresh out of bootcamps etc. at first
